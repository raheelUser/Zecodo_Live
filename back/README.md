# Deployment Details

## Description

The code has been deployed over the AWS EC2 machine in the frankfurt region, in docker swarm cluster. The code has been pacakaged into the docker image and the images has been published into the gitlab container registry, and then a swarm service has been deployed using that image.


## CI/CD Pipelines

The deployment has been automated by Gitlab CI Pipeline for each environment i.e staging and production.
For staging the deployment will be automatically triggered whenever a Merge request or Push has been committed into "master" branch Only. the pipeline will take care of complete deployment steps.

Remember for production, the pipeline will not be initiated automatically, it should be initiliazed by play button found in the CI/CD > pipeline section over gitlab UI. You have to deploy the production build manually whenever that is required.

## Environment Variables

The env file has been managed by Gitlab CI/CD secrets now, you can find them in Settings > CI/CD > Variables Section > Expand it to locate for ENV_FILE, the entries can be added/updated there and in the next build they will automatically be copied into your image build.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
